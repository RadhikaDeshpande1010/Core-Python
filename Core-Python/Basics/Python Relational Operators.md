  <h2>Relational Operators (also called as Comparison Operators)</h2>
  <p>In Python, comparison operators are used to compare the values of two operands (elements being compared). They return a Boolean result (True or False) based on whether the comparison is true. Try the following: </p>

  | Operator | Description               | Example   | Result  |
  |----------|---------------------------|-----------|---------|
  | `>`      | Greater than              | `3 > 2`   | `True`  |
  | `<`      | Less than                 | `3 < 2`   | `False` |
  | `>=`     | Greater than or equal to  | `5 >= 3`  | `True`  |
  | `<=`     | Less than or equal to     | `10 <= 5` | `False` |
  | `==`     | Equal to                  | `2 == 3`  | `False` |
  | `==`     | Equal to                  | `2 == 2`  | `True`  |
  | `!=`     | Not equal to              | `2 != 2`  | `False` |

  <h4>:black_small_square: Greater than (>)</h4>
  <p>Greater than: True if the left operand is greater than the right</p>
  
  ```python
  Input
  3 > 2
  
  Output
  True
  ```
  <h4>:black_small_square: Less than (<)</h4>
  <p>Less than: True if the left operand is less than the right</p>
  
  ```python
  Input
  3 < 2
  
  Output
  False
  ```
  <h4>:black_small_square: Greater than or equal to (>=)</h4>
  <p>Multiplication: multiplies two operands</p>
  
  ```python
  Input
  5 >= 3
  
  Output
  True
  ```
  <h4>:black_small_square: Less than equal to (<=)</h4>
  <p>Less than or equal to: True if the left operand is less than or equal to the right</p>
  
  ```python
  Input
  10 <= 5
  
  Output
  False
  ```
  <h4>:black_small_square: Double equal to (==)</h4>
  <p>Double equal to: True if two values are equal</p>

  <h6>Example 1:</h6>
  
  ```python
  Input
  2 == 3
  
  Output
  False
  ```

 <h6>Example 2:</h6>
 
  ```python
  Input
  2 == 2
    
  Output
  True
  ```
  <h4>:black_small_square: Not equal to (!=)</h4>
  <p>Not equal to: True if operands are not equal</p>
  
  ```python
  Input
  2 != 2
  
  Output
  False
  ```
