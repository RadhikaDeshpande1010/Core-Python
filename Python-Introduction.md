  <p>Python has an interesting and well-documented history! It was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and released publicly in 1991.</p>
  <p>Named After Monty Python- Python isnâ€™t named after the snakeâ€”it was inspired by the British comedy group Monty Python. Thatâ€™s why Python documentation often includes references to their sketches.</p>
  Here's a quick timeline of Pythonâ€™s development:

  <h4>:black_small_square: Python 1.x (1991-2000)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Pythonâ€™s <b>first version (1.0)</b> was later released in <b>January 1994</b>.</li>
    <li>Notable characteristics comprised of dynamic typing, modules, methods, and exception handling.</li>
    <li>The basic principles of simplicity and readability, which the language is known for was founded.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>:black_small_square: Python 2.x (2000-2010)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>In <b>October 2000</b>, the <b>second version</b> came out; Python 2.0.</li>
    <li>Added features such as support for Unicode, garbage collector, and list comprehension.</li>
    <li>Python 2.0 did preserve backward compatibility but also had some shortcomings that led to the formation of Python 3.</li>
    <li>Python 2.0 was shelved on <b>January 1st, 2020</b>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>:black_small_square: Python 3.x (2008-Present)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The third version came out in <b>December 2008, version 3.0</b>.</li>
    <li>Great improvements were added on the Python interface like:
      <ul>
        <li>Added and improved support for Unicode</li>
        <li>Use of the <b>print()</b> function instead of the print statement</li>
        <li>Improved division for integers</li>
        <li>Better structured standard library</li>
        <li>Use of type hinting</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Today, the driving force behind the latest Python versions are performance and usability.</li>
